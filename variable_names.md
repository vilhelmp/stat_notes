# Variable names   

Reading statistic information you often come across lots of names of the same thing. So I created this table to make it easier.   



|  y variable | x variable |  
|------------:|------------|  
|      y      |     x      |  
| left hand side (LHS)  | right hand side (RHS) |  
| dependent  | independent |  
| endog     |   exog  |  
| endogenous | exogenous |  
| regressand  |  regressors |  
| outcome  | design  |  
| explained  | explanatory  |  
| response  | control  |
